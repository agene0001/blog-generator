## 1. The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island

### A Symbol of Freedom
The Statue of Liberty, a gift from France, was dedicated on October 28, 1886.
It has since become a symbol of freedom and democracy worldwide.
Located on Liberty Island, this colossal statue stands 305 feet tall, crowned by a golden flame.
To truly appreciate the intricate details, visitors can ascend to the crown for a panoramic view of New York Harbor.

### A Journey Through Immigration
Adjacent to Liberty Island lies Ellis Island, the site of the United States' busiest immigrant processing station from 1892 to 1954.
Over 12 million immigrants passed through its halls in search of a new life.
Today, the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration offers visitors an immersive experience with exhibits, photographs, and personal stories.
The touching stories highlighted in the museum offer a profound insight into the human spirit and the pursuit of the American Dream.

### Planning Your Visit
To visit both locations, reserve your tickets in advance through the Statue Cruises website.
The ferry ride provides stunning views of the NYC skyline and the harbor, making it an integral part of the experience.
Arriving early is recommended as lines can grow quickly, especially during peak tourist seasons.

Central Park, stretching over 843 acres, is a green jewel in the heart of Manhattan.
